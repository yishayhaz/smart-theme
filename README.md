# Smart Theme

The problem is that during the day there's a lot of sunlight right into my screen, so light are the better option, but I don't want to get flashbanged when I want to code at 2AM, So this tool is here to make your coding life a little brighter (or darker, depending on your roomâ€™s vibe)!

## Commands / Usage

### Set themes

Default themes are: Solarized Light, Solarized Dark

Command panel: `Smart Theme: Set Light Theme`, `Smart Theme: Set Dark Theme`

### Set time

Default time is: 6, 18

Set the time when the theme should change to light or dark mode.

Command panel: `Smart Theme: Set Light Theme Time`, `Smart Theme: Set Dark Theme Time`

## How does it work?

Using Cron jobs, it will change the theme at the specified time.
